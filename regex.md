# Regular expressions

- Simple Regular Expressions (SRE)
    - Used on Unix based systems for backwards compatibility
    - Most regular-expression-aware Unix utilities, use it by default while providing support for extended regular expressions with command line arguments
    - Deprecated on POSIX compliant systems and should not be used by new utilities
